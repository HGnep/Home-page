# Home-page
Project to create my own startpage in my browser since I don't like the default one and think it could use some more

# old
started this project a while back. It's nice, I had lots of ideas but lost my interest after a while

# new
Restarted this project - the design is (I think) a bit better. There are plans of creating this with React but started in plain old HTML (+JS+CSS) since that's what I'm familiair with.
